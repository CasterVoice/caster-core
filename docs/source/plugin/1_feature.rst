State
-----

Plugins are provided with a state store which is persisted between Caster restarts. This can be useful if a plugin benefits from caching data or requires persisting other data.

Note that stored data is presently not encrypted.


Configuration
-------------

.. note::

    Work in progress

Plugins can themselves define how they may be configured by the user.
